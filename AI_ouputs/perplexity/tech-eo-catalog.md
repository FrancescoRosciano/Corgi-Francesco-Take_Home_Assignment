## What Founders Should Watch For

### 1. **Definition of Technology Services/Products**
- **Broad vs. Narrow**: Look for policies that define "Technology Services" and "Technology Products" broadly to include all your current and future offerings
- **Custom vs. Packaged Software**: Ensure both custom development and packaged software products are covered
- **Cloud Services**: Verify coverage for SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and other cloud service models

### 2. **Contractual Liability Carve-Backs**
- **Limited vs. Unlimited Contractual**: Some policies exclude all contractual liability; others cover "unintentional breach" of contracts
- **Indemnification Clauses**: Check whether the policy covers contractual indemnification obligations you assume
- **Hold Harmless Agreements**: Understand exclusions for hold harmless clauses in customer contracts

### 3. **Hammer Clause Provisions**
- **Traditional Hammer**: Insurer can force settlement; if you refuse, you pay percentage of excess damages
- **No Hammer/Soft Hammer**: Insurer must obtain your consent to settle; various cost-sharing arrangements if you refuse reasonable settlement
- **Modified Hammer**: Hybrid approaches with different cost-sharing percentages

### 4. **Defense Costs Inside/Outside Limits**
- **Defense Inside**: Defense costs erode your policy limit (common in tech E&O)
- **Defense Outside**: Defense costs are in addition to limits (rare in tech E&O)
- **Shared Limits**: Defense costs may share limits with certain coverages but not others

### 5. **Retroactive Date & Extended Reporting Period (ERP)**
- **Retroactive Date**: Acts before this date are not covered; negotiate for unlimited retroactive date if possible
- **ERP Options**: Ability to purchase "tail" coverage when policy cancels; automatic vs. optional ERP
- **Continuous Coverage**: Ensure smooth transition between policy periods to avoid gaps
