# Founder Summary

**What this is.** A combined Tech E\&O + Cyber/Media policy with third-party liability (tech, professional services, media, privacy/regulatory) and first-party cover (BI/extra expense, data recovery, cyber-extortion), plus 18-month breach-response costs. Defense is **duty to defend** and erodes limits; there’s a **soft 70% hammer** if you reject a recommended settlement. Coverage is **claims-made & reported** for third-party; first-party applies to incidents discovered and reported in-period.

**What’s covered (high level).**

* **Tech E\&O & Professional Services**: claims from failures in your tech/services; includes media torts under a media grant, privacy/security liability, and privacy regulatory defense/fines where insurable.
* **First-party**: cyber BI/extra expense after a waiting period, data recovery, and cyber-extortion.
* **Breach response**: legal, forensics, notification/PR/monitoring expenses for **18 months** from notice.

**What’s excluded (notable).**

* **Pure contract/SLA risk**, patent, unsolicited comms (TCPA/CAN-SPAM), antitrust/unfair competition (with privacy/media carve-backs), trade-secret claims (carve-back if driven by a cyber breach), bodily injury/property damage, internal disputes, infrastructure (power/Internet) failures not under your control, government orders, and your own unlawful data collection (except rogue-employee carve-back).

**Limits & sublimits.**

* Limits can be **Combined** (one aggregate across all grants) or **Separate** (separate aggregate for third/first-party and a separate aggregate for breach response). Sublimits reduce—not add to—aggregates. Retentions and waiting period are schedule-driven. Territory is **worldwide** (except OFAC-barred).

**Definitions & carve-outs that matter.**

* **Technology Services** is broad (SaaS/PaaS/IaaS/managed, hosting, design, install, maintain, consulting). **Network** means systems **owned/operated/controlled by, or leased by, you**, which shapes first-party triggers and limits dependent-BI. **Third Party Wrongful Act** bundles tech, professional, media, and privacy/security wrongful acts.

**Mechanics founders care about.**

* **Trigger**: claims-made & reported (third-party); first-party incidents must be discovered and reported in-period, with retro date and knowledge conditions.
* **Defense**: insurer **selects counsel**; claim expenses **erode** limits.
* **Settlement (hammer)**: refuse a recommended settlement and the insurer caps its obligation and pays only **70%** of post-refusal damages/expenses.
* **Tail**: automatic 60-day ERP; optional 1/2/3/6-year tails for stated premiums.

**Pros**

* **Broad Tech/Cyber scope** in one form (Tech E\&O, media, privacy/regulatory, first-party BI/extortion/data recovery).
* **18-month** breach-response window—longer runway for class actions and regulatory clean-up.
* **Carve-backs** preserve coverage in tricky areas (privacy/regulatory within antitrust/consumer-protection; trade-secrets when caused by a cyber breach).
* **Choice of Combined vs Separate limits** allows structuring how BI/first-party and breach response erode aggregates.

**Cons**

* **Defense inside limits**: legal spend eats the same pot as settlements—watch limits.
* **Soft 70% hammer**: rejecting a reasonable settlement can materially shift costs back to you.
* **Infrastructure failure exclusion**: utility/backbone Internet/power outages not under your control are out.
* **Dependent BI gap** in base form: first-party BI requires a **cyber breach to your Network** (systems you own/operate/control/lease); pure third-party provider outages aren’t clearly within first-party BI. Consider endorsements.
* **Patent exclusion** and **contract/SLA limits**: common startup risks (patent suits, liquidated damages) remain uncovered.

**Best for:** B2B/B2C software or API companies that need unified Tech E\&O + Cyber with strong breach-response, ransomware, and privacy/regulatory protection—and who can manage SLA/patent/dependent-BI exposures via contract and add-ons.
