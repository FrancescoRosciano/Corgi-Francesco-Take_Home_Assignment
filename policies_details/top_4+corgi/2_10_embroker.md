# Founder Summary

This PDF is a **marketing overview** of Embroker’s Tech E\&O / Cyber, not a specimen policy. It lists high-level coverages (e.g., cyber liability, professional negligence, defects/errors, contractual liability, product-launch delay) and a few exclusions, but it **doesn’t provide** the mechanics founders need to buy with confidence (limits, retentions, sublimits, definitions, trigger, defense/hammer).&#x20;

**What’s covered (per the PDF)**

* Cyber liability: breach, cyber-theft, cyber-vandalism.&#x20;
* Professional negligence: product mistakes/tech errors causing client loss.&#x20;
* Defects/errors in software or hardware.&#x20;
* Contractual liability tied to unmet obligations.&#x20;
* Product launch delays at a specified time.&#x20;

**What’s excluded (per the PDF)**

* Criminal/illegal acts; financial insolvency.&#x20;
* Copyright/libel and other IP infringement—steer to separate IP/media coverage per FAQ.&#x20;

**Limits & sublimits**

* Not stated anywhere in this PDF (no aggregate/per-claim limits, retentions, or sublimits).&#x20;

**Definitions & carve-outs**

* No definitions (e.g., Professional/Technology Services, Wrongful Act) or carve-outs are provided here. These determine what’s actually covered day-to-day, so you’ll need the specimen.&#x20;

**Pros**

* Clear, founder-friendly framing of common Tech E\&O / Cyber claim types (negligence, defects, contractual shortfalls).&#x20;
* Mentions product-launch delay—a pain point for release-driven teams.&#x20;
* Signals combined Tech E\&O + Cyber posture in one program.

**Cons**

* No **specimen terms**: limits, retentions, sublimits (e.g., forensics, BI/DBI, regulatory fines/PCI), territory/jurisdiction are missing.
* No **core mechanics**: claims-made trigger, prior acts/retro date, ERP/tail, defense costs inside/outside, consent-to-settle/hammer not shown.
* No **definitions** (Professional/Technology Services, Wrongful Act), which are essential to know what work and failures are in-scope.
* IP/media risks appear **excluded** here unless you buy separate coverage.&#x20;

**Best for**

* Early scoping only. To actually purchase or compare against other carriers, request the **full specimen policy** (coverage part, exclusions, conditions, definitions, and declarations) and quote—including **limits, retentions, and sublimits**—before deciding.
