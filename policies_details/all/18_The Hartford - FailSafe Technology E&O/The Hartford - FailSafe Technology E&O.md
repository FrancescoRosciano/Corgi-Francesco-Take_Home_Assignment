## WHY YOUR TECHNOLOGY CLIENTS NEED FAILSAFE
Technology is integral to the operation of most businesses today.  
When technology fails, the financial impacts can be significant, and the companies affected often look to their technology product or service providers for compensation. Unfortunately, traditional liability policies aren’t designed to respond to pure financial losses.

PROTECTION FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES
Not all companies need the same level of protection. That’s why we developed our FailSafe® product suite, which features three increasingly robust coverage options.  
FailSafe can be tailored to your clients’ unique business needs.

### FAILSAFE MEGA®
Superior E&O coverage available only to Spectrum® Business Owner’s Policy clients.*

### FAILSAFE GIGA®
A standalone E&O policy available to all tech companies.

### FAILSAFE TERA®
A more robust E&O product, which expands the coverage of FailSafe GIGA.

In situations like these, you want to know that your technology client is covered. At The Hartford, we believe that professional liability is an essential part of a comprehensive insurance program for all technology companies. That’s why we developed the FailSafe Technology Liability Product Suite. FailSafe addresses the errors and omissions (E&O) exposures for technology companies of all sizes and, in conjunction with The Hartford’s standard lines solutions, can help provide protection for your technology clients.

Prepare. Protect. Prevail. continued
