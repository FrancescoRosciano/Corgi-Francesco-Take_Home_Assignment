Chubb has handled technology-driven claims and cyber incidents, and underwritten exposures for high-technology policyholders for more than 30+ years. Over this time, the world has become an increasingly interconnected web of technology and data. Today, businesses face numerous cyber exposures that are enterprise risks, which require an enterprise risk management solution: Chubb’s DigiTech® Enterprise Risk Management Policy (DigiTech® ERM).

With DigiTech® ERM and Chubb’s approach to Widespread Events coverage, businesses can tailor coverage to their unique exposures and needs, providing for greater coverage certainty and also providing long-term stability in the cyber insurance marketplace.

# New Endorsements Introduced in 2021

- Cybercrime coverage by endorsement or explicitly provided under separate cover from Chubb’s industry-leading Fidelity and Crime products.
- Widespread Event Endorsement addresses cyber incidents with widespread impact, affecting parties with no relationship to the Insured. Similar to how flood and earthquake risks are addressed in property policies—coverage, limits, retentions, and coinsurance can be tailored for all Widespread Events, or by the following specific perils:
  - Widespread Severe Known Vulnerability Exploits
  - Widespread Severe Zero Day Exploits
  - Widespread Software Supply Chain Exploits
  - All Other Widespread Events
- Ransomware Encounter Endorsement addresses the increasing risk of ransomware by allowing for a tailored set of coverage limits, retention amounts, and coinsurance to apply uniformly across all cyber coverages.
- Neglected Software Exploit Endorsement recognizes and rewards good software-patching hygiene by providing full coverage for 45 days, and then gradually re-weights risk sharing between the Insured and Insurer for software that remains unpatched beyond 45 days.
- Cyber Incident Response Expenses with expansive consumer-based solutions that are ahead of regulatory requirements.
- Online quoting and real-time policy issuance for eligible small risks. Referred risks will receive fast turnarounds from your Chubb underwriter.
- Industry-leading coverage designed to address evolving regulatory, legal, and cybersecurity standards and built to consider future changes.
- Easy-to-read form is aligned with the flow of a typical cyber incident in order to aid decision-making throughout.
