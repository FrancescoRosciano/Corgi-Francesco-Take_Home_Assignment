# Important Notices

## Understanding the Policy

You should read the entire Policy carefully, including the definitions and the exclusions to ensure that it meets your requirements. We recommend that you consult an insurance adviser to ensure a clear understanding of your rights and obligations under this insurance contract.

## Claims Made and Notified Policy

Some covers under Sections 1 and 3 of this Policy are on a claims made and notified policy. We shall only cover you for claims made against you during the Policy Period and notified to us as soon as practicable during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period.

Except as may be provided under Standard Extension 1.4 (Continuity of Cover), the Policy does not provide cover in relation to facts or circumstances known to you before the commencement of the Policy.

## Your duty of disclosure

When you are completing the Proposal it is important that you understand you are answering questions for yourself and anyone else that you want to be covered by the Policy.

Before you enter into the Policy, you have a duty to tell us anything that you know, or could reasonably be expected to know, which may affect our decision to insure you and on what terms. You have this duty until we agree to insure you.

You have the same duty before you renew, extend, vary or reinstate the Policy. You do not need to tell us anything that:
- reduces the risk we insure you for;
- is common knowledge;
- we know or should know as an insurer; or
- we waive your duty to tell us about.

If you do not tell us something
If you do not tell us anything you are required to, we may cancel your contract or reduce the amount we shall pay you if you make a
claim, or both.

If your failure to tell us is fraudulent, we may refuse to pay a claim and treat the contract as if it never existed.

## Notification of Facts that might give rise to a claim

Section 40(3) of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) provides that if you give notice in writing to us of facts that might give rise to a claim against you as soon as reasonably practicable after you become aware of such facts but before the insurance cover provided by the Policy expires, then we are not relieved of liability under the Policy in respect of the claim, when made, by reason only that it was made after the expiration of the period of the insurance cover provided by the Policy.

Where you provide us with personal and or sensitive information about others, you represent to us that you have made them aware of that disclosure and of our privacy policy and that you have obtained their consent.

If you do not consent to provide us with the personal and or sensitive information that we request, or withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your personal and or sensitive information at any stage, we may not be able to offer or continue to offer you the products or provide the services that you seek including claims assessment and handling.

We have Complaints Handling and Dispute Resolution processes in place. We aim to respond to a complaint or to a dispute within 15 business days once we have all necessary information and have completed any investigation that may be needed.

If we cannot respond within 15 business days, we shall let you know as soon as practicable within the 15 business day time frame, and nominate a reasonable alternative time. When doing this we shall attempt where possible to meet any reasonable time requirements you express.

We shall keep you informed about the progress of your complaint or dispute every 10 business days until we have responded to you on it.

It will then be independently reviewed by our Internal Dispute Resolution Panel comprising employees with appropriate experience, knowledge and authority who have not been involved in the matter before.

## The General Insurance Code of Practice

We abide by the General Insurance Code of Practice (Code). The Terms of the Code require us to be open, fair and honest in our dealings with you.

# Preamble

Subject to payment of the Premium, and subject to all the provisions of the Policy, and, in reliance upon the disclosures made in the
Proposal, the Insured and the Insurer agree as follows:

# Section 1: Professional Liability

## Insuring Clauses
### 1.1 Civil Liability
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Loss which the Insured is legally liable to pay for any Claim first made against
the Insured during the Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting
Period alleging civil liability arising from the Provision of Technology Services.

### 1.2 Costs and Expenses
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Costs and Expenses in the defence or settlement of any Claim covered under
Section 1.

## Section 1: Professional Liability Extensions
The Extensions in this “Extensions” Section apply in respect of Section 1 (Professional Liability) of the Policy but only if they are
specified as “Included” in the Schedule.

### 1.3 Competition and Consumer Act
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Loss which the Insured is legally liable to pay for any Claim first made against
the Insured during the Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting
Period alleging misleading or deceptive conduct under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), or any equivalent state or
territory provisions, by the Insured in the Provision of Technology Services.

### 1.4 Continuity of Cover
Notwithstanding Exclusion 1.29 (b) and (c) (Prior or Pending Matters), the Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Loss or
Inquiry Costs which the Insured is legally liable to pay for any Claim or Inquiry first made against, or served upon, the Insured
during the Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period,
resulting from facts or circumstances which were known to the Insured but notified to the Insurer after the Inception Date,
provided that:

a)     such facts or circumstances were not notified under any earlier insurance policy;
b)     such facts or circumstances did not constitute a Claim or Inquiry as at the Inception Date; and
c)     the Insured has held a comparable Technology Liability policy issued by the Insurer which has been continually renewed without
       any interruption since the Insured could or should first became aware of such facts or circumstances.

The Insurer may reduce its liability to the extent of any prejudice suffered in connection with the failure to notify such facts or
circumstances. The cover provided by this Extension shall not result in any payment greater than the amount that would have been
paid under the earliest policy to which the notification could have been made.

Any limit of liability applying to that policy is part of, and not in addition to, the Limit of Liability of the Policy and any amount paid
under this Extension shall erode the Limit of Liability and Sub-Limits of Liability.

### 1.5 Contractual Penalties
Notwithstanding Exclusion 1.20(d), the Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, contractual penalties which the Insured is
legally liable to pay arising directly from a Claim first made against the Insured, or Inquiry first served upon the Insured, during the
Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period, provided that such
penalties arise from a contract for the Provision of Technology Services, are insurable at law and do not result from Fraud
or Dishonesty.

This shall not apply to PCI (Payment Card Industry) fines and penalties.


---


## 1.6 Court and Inquiry Attendance Costs
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Court and Inquiry Attendance Costs incurred by an Insured who is required
to attend any legal proceeding or at an Inquiry which is the subject of cover under the Policy.

## 1.7 Criminal Prosecution
Notwithstanding Exclusion 4.4 (Fraud or Dishonesty), the Insurer agrees to pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Costs and Expenses
of legal representation arising out of a criminal prosecution first made against the Insured during the Policy Period and notified to the
Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period alleging criminal liability arising from the Provision
of Technology Services, provided that:

* a) the Insurer shall be entitled to nominate a solicitor or barrister to represent the prosecuted Insured;
* b) the Insured shall give to the Insurer written notice of any such criminal prosecution or notice of any criminal prosecution made
  against the Insured as soon as practicable but in no event later than fourteen (14) days of the Insured becoming aware of any
  criminal prosecution or notice of criminal prosecution, and always within the Policy Period or any applicable Extended
  Reporting Period;
* c) shall keep the Insurer fully informed as regards all developments relating thereto as soon as practicable; and
* d) in the event that the Insured is found guilty the Insured shall repay to the Insurer within fourteen (14) days of such conviction all
  of the Costs and Expenses incurred or paid by the Insurer under this Extension.

## 1.8 Defamation
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Loss which the Insured is legally liable to pay for any Claim first made against
the Insured during the Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting
Period alleging any unintentional libel, slander, defamation or injurious falsehood by the Insured in the Provision of
Technology Services.

## 1.9 Emergency Costs
Notwithstanding Claims Condition 5.2 (Reporting and Notice) and 5.5 (Consent to Payments), the Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of
the Insured, Costs and Expenses and Inquiry Costs insured under Section 1 (Professional Liability) of the Policy which are incurred
by the Insured in cases of emergency or legal restraint where it was not possible for the Insured to obtain the Insurer’s prior written
consent provided that:

* a) the Insured shall not admit liability or negotiate any settlement; and
* b) the Insured obtains the retrospective consent of the Insurer as soon as practicable but not later than the end of the Policy Period.

## 1.10 Extended Reporting Period
If, at the Expiry Date, the Policy is renewed or replaced by another Policy with the Insurer, the Insured will be entitled to an
Extended Reporting Period of ninety (90) days, commencing at the expiration of the Policy Period.

If, at the Expiry Date, the Policy is neither renewed nor replaced, the Insured will be entitled to an Extended Reporting Period of
ninety (90) days, commencing at the expiration of the Policy Period, provided that:

* a) the Extended Reporting Period is requested in writing within thirty (30) days of the Expiry Date; and
* b) an additional premium of one hundred (100) per cent of the previous annual premium is remitted within thirty (30) days of the
  Expiry Date.

During the Extended Reporting Period, the Insured may notify a Claim or Inquiry provided that such Claim or Inquiry was first
made against, or notified to, the Insured before the Expiry Date, or the Insured first became aware of such fact or circumstance that
may give rise to a Claim or Inquiry before the Expiry Date.

The exercise of any applicable Extended Reporting Period will not in any way increase the Limit of Liability of the Policy.

## 1.11 Innocent Insured
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Costs and Expenses resulting from Fraud or Dishonesty which would, in the
absence of Exclusion 4.4 (Fraud or Dishonesty), be covered under the Policy.

This Extension shall not provide cover to an Insured that has committed or condoned any Fraud or Dishonesty.


---


# No coverage is provided under this Extension if the Fraud or Dishonesty is actually or allegedly committed or condoned by shareholders who own more than five per cent (5%), or the principals or directors of the Policyholder or any Subsidiary.

## 1.12 Inquiry Costs
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Inquiry Costs incurred in preparing for and being represented at an Inquiry first served upon the Insured during the Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period.

## 1.13 Intellectual Property
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, the Loss which the Insured is legally liable to pay for any Claim first made against the Insured during the Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period alleging that the Insured has unintentionally infringed intellectual property rights in the Provision of Technology Services.

No coverage is provided under this Extension for any Claim resulting from any actual or alleged infringement of patent or the misappropriation of trade secrets.

## 1.14 Loss Mitigation
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, costs and expenses incurred by the Insured in taking action to rectify, or to mitigate the effects of, any act, error or omission of the Insured in the performance of the Provision of Technology Services that would otherwise result in a covered claim under the Policy, provided that the Insured:

a)     first discovers and notifies the Insurer of such act, error or omission during the Policy Period;
b)     notifies the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period of its intention to take such action;
c)     establishes to the satisfaction of the Insurer that:

       i)       the act, error or omission would otherwise result in a covered Claim;
       ii)      the proposed mitigation costs are less than the likely costs of such Claim; and
       iii)     such costs are proportionate to the likely costs of such Claim in all of the circumstances. No coverage is provided under this Optional Extension for any:

d)     indirect costs and expenses such as loss, diminution or additional profit, bonus, incentive payment or opportunity cost;
e)     salary, wages, overheads, administrative or office costs of the Insured;
f)     costs and expenses which would result in any betterment;
g)     liability that arises from taking such action; or
h)     Retention.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Extension in the event of an emergency which poses an immediate threat to life or property the Insured shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate potential Loss and shall thereafter comply with the provisions of this Extension as soon as reasonably practicable.

## 1.15 Principal’s Liability
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Principal, Loss which the Principal is legally liable to pay for any Claim arising from any act, error or omission of the Insured and for which the Insured is liable; provided that, and only to the extent that, the Claim against the Principal would have been covered under this Policy had such a Claim been brought directly against the Insured.

For the purpose of this Extension only;

a)     Loss does not include consequential loss; and
b)     whilst the Principal is not an Insured, the Principal shall comply with the terms and obligations of the Policy and at law generally as if they were an Insured.

## 1.16 Professional Liability for Cyber Events
The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Loss which the Insured is legally liable to pay for any Claim first made against the Insured during the Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period.


---


# 1.17 Vicarious Liability

The Insurer shall pay for, or on behalf of the Insured, Loss which the Insured is legally liable to pay for any Claim first made against the Insured during the Policy Period and notified to the Insurer during the Policy Period or any applicable Extended Reporting Period alleging civil liability arising from the Provision of Technology Services by consultants, contractors, sub-consultants or sub-contractors of an Insured.

## Section 1: Professional Liability Optional Extensions

The Extensions in this “Optional Extensions” Section of the Policy apply in respect of Section 1 (Professional Liability) but only if they are specified as “Included” in the Schedule.

## 1.18 Reinstatement

Notwithstanding General Condition 6.1 (Limit of Liability), in the event of the exhaustion of the Limit of Liability for this Section and exhaustion of any applicable excess layer, the Limit of Liability shall be reinstated once for this Section in respect of any future Claims or Inquiries which are not causally connected to any act, error or omission alleged in any Claim or Inquiry paid under the Policy.

The maximum amount payable under the reinstated Limit of Liability shall not exceed the Limit of Liability.

### Exclusions

No cover shall be provided under Section 1 for, arising out of, or in any way connected with:

## 1.19 Adjustment, Repair, Replacement and Withdrawal Expenses Related to Provision of Professional Services or Technology Product

any Claim arising from any adjustment, disposal, inspection, recall, removal, repair, replacement or withdrawal of:

a) the Provision of Technology Services or any Technology Product;
b) any property on which any Provision of Technology Services is or was performed; or

# 5.4 Insurer’s Right to Assume Conduct
The Insurer shall, in its discretion, be entitled to conduct in the name of the Insured, the defence or settlement of any Claim, including but not limited to a claim against the Insured covered under Section 2 (Public and Technology Products Liability), and the management and conduct of any Inquiry.

## 5.5 Consent to Payments
The Insured shall obtain the written consent of the Insurer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, before any amounts payable under the Policy are incurred.

The Insurer shall only be liable under the Policy for payment of any Costs and Expenses, Supplementary Costs or any other amounts which are reasonable and necessary.

## 5.6 Right to Contest
Where there is a dispute between the Insurer and the Insured as to whether a settlement is reasonable or whether a Claim, including but not limited to a claim against the Insured covered under Section 2 (Public and Technology Products Liability), should continue to be defended, the Insurer will refer the matter to a Senior Counsel to determine the issue, taking into consideration the prospects of a successful defence or settlement options.

Where the Insured does not agree with the Senior Counsel determination, the Insured may elect to continue the defence of the Claim, however the Insurer’s liability will not exceed the amount for which the Claim could have been settled plus the Costs and Expenses or Supplementary Payments incurred up to the date of such election. The Senior Counsel’s expenses in providing such determination will be paid by the Insurer and any such payments will erode the Limit of Liability.

## 5.7 Allocation
If a Claim, Inquiry, Occurrence or any other matter is partially covered under the Policy, the Insured and the Insurer shall use their best efforts to agree upon a fair and proper allocation between such covered matters and not-covered matters based upon the relative legal and financial exposures and the relative benefits obtained by the parties.

If the Insurer and the Insured cannot agree on allocation within thirty (30) days of any allocation issue first notified in writing to the Insured by the Insurer, they agree to refer the determination to a Senior Counsel. The Senior Counsel is to determine the fair and proper allocation as an expert not an arbitrator. The Insured and the Insurer shall be entitled to make written submissions to Senior Counsel. The Senior Counsel is to take account of the parties’ submissions, but the Senior Counsel is not to be confined by such submissions and is to determine the fair and proper allocation in accordance with their own judgement and opinion. The Senior Counsel’s expenses in providing such determination will be paid by the Insurer and any such payments will not erode the Limit of Liability.

Whilst a dispute as to allocation of any matter claimed under the Policy remains unresolved, the Insurer shall advance such amounts it considers to be a fair and proper allocation. The allocation finally agreed or determined shall be applied retrospectively to any amounts incurred or paid.

## 5.8 Advancement of Cost and Expenses and Inquiry Costs
Once the Insurer has received written notice of a Claim or Inquiry under the Policy, it shall advance Costs and Expenses or Inquiry Costs as and when incurred, but no later than thirty (30) days after the Insurer has received itemised bills for those Costs and Expenses or Inquiry Costs.

Such payments by the Insurer shall be repaid to the Insurer by the Insured in the event and to the extent that any such Insured is subsequently determined not to be entitled to cover under the Policy.
