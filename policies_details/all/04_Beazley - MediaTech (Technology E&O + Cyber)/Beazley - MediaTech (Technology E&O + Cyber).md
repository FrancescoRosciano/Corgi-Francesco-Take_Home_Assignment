# LIMIT OF LIABILITY AND COVERAGE

The Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability listed in the Declarations (the “Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability”) is the Underwriters’ combined total limit of liability for all Loss payable under this Policy.

The limit of liability payable under each insuring agreement will be an amount equal to the Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability unless another amount is listed in the Declarations. Such amount is the aggregate amount payable under this Policy pursuant to such insuring agreement and is part of, and not in addition to, the Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability.

All Dependent Business Loss payable under this Policy is part of and not in addition to the Business Interruption Loss limit listed in the Declarations.

The Underwriters will not be obligated to pay any Loss, or to defend any Claim, after the Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability has been exhausted, or after deposit of the Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability in a court of competent jurisdiction.

## RETENTIONS

The Retention listed in the Declarations applies separately to each act, error, omission, incident, event or related acts, errors, omissions, incidents or events giving rise to a Claim or Loss. The Retention will be satisfied by monetary payments by the Named Insured of covered Loss under each insuring agreement. If any Loss arising out of an incident or Claim is subject to more than one Retention, the Retention for each applicable insuring agreement will apply to such Loss, provided that the sum of such Retention amounts will not exceed the largest applicable Retention amount.

Coverage for Business Interruption Loss and Dependent Business Loss will apply after the Waiting Period has elapsed and the Underwriters will then indemnify the Named Insured for all Business Interruption Loss and Dependent Business Loss sustained during the Period of Restoration in excess of the Retention.

Satisfaction of the applicable Retention is a condition precedent to the payment of any Loss under this Policy, and the Underwriters will be liable only for the amounts in excess of such Retention.

## OPTIONAL EXTENSION PERIOD

Upon non-renewal or cancellation of this Policy for any reason except the non-payment of premium, the Named Insured will have the right to purchase, for additional premium in the amount of the Optional Extension Premium percentage listed in the Declarations of the full Policy Premium listed in the Declarations, an Optional Extension Period for the period of time listed in the Declarations. Coverage provided by such Optional Extension Period will only apply to Claims first made against any Insured during the Optional Extension Period and reported to the Underwriters during the Optional Extension Period, and arising out of any act, error or omission committed on or after the Retroactive Date (if applicable) and before the end of the Policy Period. In order for the Named Insured to invoke the Optional Extension Period option, the payment of the additional premium for the Optional Extension Period must be paid to the Underwriters within 60 days of the termination of this Policy.

The purchase of the Optional Extension Period will in no way increase the Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability or any sublimit of liability. At the commencement of the Optional Extension Period the entire premium will be deemed earned, and in the event the Named Insured terminates the

Notice of an actual or reasonably suspected Data Breach or Security Breach in conformance with this paragraph will also constitute notice of a circumstance that could reasonably be the basis for a Claim.

The Named Insured will provide the Underwriters a proof of Data Recovery Costs, Business Interruption Loss and Dependent Business Loss, and this Policy will cover the reasonable and necessary costs, not to exceed USD 50,000, that the Named Insured incurs to contract with a third party to prepare such proof. All loss described in this paragraph must be reported, and all proofs of loss must be provided, to the Underwriters no later than 6 months after the end of the Policy Period.

---



# Regulatory Proceeding
Defense counsel will be mutually agreed by the Named Insured and the Underwriters but, in the absence of such agreement, the Underwriters’ decision will be final.

With respect to the Payment Card Liabilities & Costs insuring agreement, coverage will be provided on an indemnity basis and legal counsel will be mutually agreed by the Named Insured and the Underwriters.

The Underwriters will pay actual loss of salary and reasonable expenses resulting from the attendance by a corporate officer of the Insured Organization at any mediation meetings, arbitration proceedings, hearings, depositions, or trials relating to the defense of any Claim, subject to a maximum of USD 2,000 per day and USD 100,000 in the aggregate, which amounts will be part of and not in addition to the Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability.

## Settlement of Claims
If the Insured refuses to consent to any settlement recommended by the Underwriters and acceptable to the claimant, the Underwriters’ liability for such Claim will not exceed:

1. the amount for which the Claim could have been settled, less the remaining Retention, plus the Claims Expenses incurred up to the time of such refusal; plus

2. sixty percent (60%) of any Claims Expenses incurred after the date such settlement or compromise was recommended to the Insured plus sixty percent (60%) of any Damages, Penalties and PCI Fines, Expenses and Costs above the amount for which the Claim could have been settled;

and the Underwriters will have the right to withdraw from the further defense of such Claim.

The Insured may settle any Claim where the Damages, Penalties, PCI Fines, Expenses and Costs and Claims Expenses do not exceed 50% of the Retention, provided that the entire Claim is resolved and the Insured obtains a full release on behalf of all Insureds from all claimants.

---


# Subrogation
If any payment is made under this Policy and there is available to the Underwriters any of the Insured's rights of recovery against any other party, then the Underwriters will maintain all such rights of recovery. The Insured will do whatever is reasonably necessary to secure such rights and will not do anything after an incident or event giving rise to a Claim or Loss to prejudice such rights. If the Insured has waived its right to subrogate against a third party through written agreement made before an incident or event giving rise to a Claim or Loss has occurred, then the Underwriters waive their rights to subrogation against such third party. Any recoveries will be applied first to subrogation expenses, second to Loss paid by the Underwriters, and lastly to the Retention. Any additional amounts recovered will be paid to the Named Insured.

## Other Insurance
The insurance under this Policy will apply in excess of any other valid and collectible insurance available to any Insured unless such other insurance is written only as specific excess insurance over this Policy. Provided, however, this Policy will become primary and non-contributory insurance as respects any insurance maintained by an Additional Insured if primary insurance is required by a contract in place between the Additional Insured and the Insured Organization, but only with respect to any Claim arising solely from the Media, Tech, Data & Network Liability insuring agreements.

## Action Against the Underwriters
No action will lie against the Underwriters or the Underwriters' representatives unless and until, as a condition precedent thereto, the Insured has fully complied with all provisions, terms and conditions of this Policy and the amount of the Insured's obligation to pay has been finally determined either by judgment or award against the Insured after trial, regulatory proceeding, arbitration or by written agreement of the Insured, the claimant, and the Underwriters.

No person or organization will have the right under this Policy to join the Underwriters as a party to an action or other proceeding against the Insured to determine the Insured's liability, nor will the Underwriters be impleaded by the Insured or the Insured's legal representative.

The Insured's bankruptcy or insolvency of the Insured's estate will not relieve the Underwriters of their obligations hereunder.

## Entire Agreement
By acceptance of the Policy, all Insureds agree that this Policy embodies all agreements between the Underwriters and the Insured relating to this Policy. Notice to any agent, or knowledge possessed by any agent or by any other person, will not affect a waiver or a change in any part of this Policy or stop the Underwriters from asserting any right under the terms of this Policy; nor will the terms of this Policy be waived or changed, except by endorsement issued to form a part of this Policy signed by the Underwriters.

## Mergers or Consolidations
If during the Policy Period the Named Insured consolidates or merges with or is acquired by another entity, or sells more than 50% of its assets to another entity, then this Policy will continue to remain in effect through the end of the Policy Period, but only with respect to events, acts or incidents that occur prior to such consolidation, merger or acquisition. There will be no coverage provided by this Policy for any other Claim or


---


# Loss

Such date of cancellation will not be less than 60 days (or 10 days for cancellation due to non-payment of premium) after the date of notice.

If this Policy is canceled in accordance with the paragraphs above, the earned premium will be computed pro rata; but the premium will be deemed fully earned if any Claim, or any circumstance that could reasonably be the basis for a Claim or Loss, is reported to the Underwriters on or before the date of cancellation. Payment or tender of unearned premium is not a condition of cancellation.

## Singular Form of a Word
Whenever the singular form of a word is used herein, the same will include the plural when required by context.

## Headings
The titles of paragraphs, clauses, provisions or endorsements of or to this Policy are intended solely for convenience and reference, and are not deemed in any way to limit or expand the provisions to which they relate and are not part of the Policy.
