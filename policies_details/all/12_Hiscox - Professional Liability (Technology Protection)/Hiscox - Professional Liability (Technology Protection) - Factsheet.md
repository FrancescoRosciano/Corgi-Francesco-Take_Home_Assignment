## Know your exposure

Breach of contract and intellectual property made up more than 80% of all technology claims handled by Hiscox over a nine year period. Traditional professional liability/errors and omissions policies offer negligence coverage only. A Hiscox policy provides affirmative breach of contract coverage not available under most standard technology errors and omissions forms, in addition to negligence coverage. When combined with our broad intellectual property coverage and other innovative solutions, Hiscox Technology Protection ensures technology companies are buying insurance that addresses their most significant exposures.
