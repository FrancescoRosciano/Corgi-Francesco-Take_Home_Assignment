No person or entity shall have any right under this policy to join us as a party to any action against you to determine your liability, nor shall we be impeded by you or their legal representatives. Subject to Condition VI. J. 2., your bankruptcy or insolvency of your estate or that of your successors in interest, as outlined in Condition VI. J. 2., shall not relieve us of our obligations under this policy.

## J. Mergers and Acquisitions

1. Newly Acquired Subsidiaries
   a. During the policy period, if you or any of your subsidiaries acquire another entity whose assets are less than or equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of your total assets as set forth in your most recent CPA prepared financial statement, coverage for any such acquired entity will only apply with respect to incidents, claims, or regulatory proceedings taking place after such acquisition if the acquired entity has no other similar insurance.

   b. During the policy period, if you or any of your subsidiaries acquire another entity whose assets are more than twenty-five percent (25%) of your total assets as set forth in your most recent CPA prepared financial statement, then you shall have no coverage under this policy for any incidents, claims, or regulatory proceedings related to the acquired entity unless:



---


1. You give us written notice at least thirty (30) days after the acquisition; and
2. Obtain our written consent to extend coverage to such additional entities and agree to pay any additional premium we require or changes in terms, conditions, exclusions, or limitations we require.
Coverage for any acquired entities shall not be available unless specifically set forth in an endorsement to this policy and will only apply with respect to incidents, claims, or regulatory proceedings taking place after such acquisition.

2. Changes in Ownership or Control
In the event of:
- a. Your liquidation (whether voluntary or compulsory);
- b. The appointment of an Administrative Receiver, Receiver, or Manager whether pursuant to any Fixed or Floating Charge or to any order of any competent court over the whole or any part of your assets or business;
- c. Any scheme of arrangement or composition with creditors;
- d. Control of you being taken over by any government or governmental authority or agency; or
- e. The acquisition of the named insured or of all or substantially all of its assets by another entity, or the merger or consolidation of the named insured into or with another entity such that the named insured is not the surviving entity;

this policy shall immediately cease to afford coverage of any kind for incidents, claims, regulatory proceedings, costs, damages, or claim expenses discovered or of which we are notified subsequent to the events outlined in subparagraphs a. through e. above. In the event that any subsidiary of yours named in the application and in the Declarations shall undergo any change of control, as described above under subparagraphs a. through e., this policy shall immediately cease to afford any coverage of any kind for incidents, claims, regulatory proceedings, costs, damages, or claim expenses with respect to such subsidiary that was discovered, or of which we are notified subsequent to the events outlined in subparagraphs a. through e. above.

You shall immediately advise us of any appointment of a trustee or examiner under the Federal law, Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, any consolidation or merger you effect with another business entity and of any purchase, assignment, transfer, pledge, or sale of assets or shares occasioning a change in ownership or control. As used in this Condition J., control means the power to determine the management or policy of a controlling holding company of yours by means of voting share ownership. A change in ownership of voting shares which results in direct or indirect ownership by a shareholder or an affiliated group of shareholders of ten percent (10%) or more of such shares shall be presumed to result in a change of control for the purposes of the required notice.

As a condition to continuation of this policy, you shall:
- (1) Give written notice to us within thirty (30) days of the event;


---


### 2. Information and notices (continued)

- (2) Promptly provide us with all such further information as we may require;
- (3) Obtain our written consent to continue some or all of the coverage provided by this policy;
- (4) Give written notice within thirty (30) days to us of your agreement to the terms and conditions which we require due to such change; and
- (5) Pay us any additional premium.

Failure to give notice to us in accordance with Paragraph (1) above or your failure to notify us of your agreement in accordance with Paragraph (4) above shall be considered as your election to not continue coverage. Notification to us, as required by this condition, shall not be considered made unless you provide such notice in writing and we make written acknowledgement. All notices and premium payments made under this paragraph shall be provided to us through the entity named in the Declarations.

### 3. Termination or Sale of a Subsidiary
If, before or during the policy period, an entity ceases to be a subsidiary, coverage with respect to such subsidiary shall continue until the termination of this policy. Such coverage continuation shall apply only with respect to incidents, claims, or regulatory proceedings taking place prior to the date such entity ceased to be a subsidiary.

### K. Joint Insureds
If two or more insureds are covered under this policy, the first named insured shall act for all insureds. Our payment to the first named insured of any costs, damages, or claim expenses you sustain shall fully release us for such costs, damages, or claim expenses. If the first named insured ceases to be covered under this policy, the insured next named shall thereafter be considered as the first named insured.

### L. Multiple Insureds
Our liability under any and all contracts of insurance evidenced or deemed to be evidenced by this contract shall be the liability so specified in this contract as applicable to any one such contract and shall not change or be deemed changed due to the number or types of insureds or costs, damages, or claim expenses under this contract.

### M. Assignment
Your interest under this policy is not assignable unless we provide written approval. If you die or are adjudged incompetent, such insurance shall cover your legal representative as the insured if permitted by this policy.

### N. Headings
The descriptions in the headings of this policy and any endorsements attached hereto are solely for convenience and form no part of the terms and conditions of coverage.

### O. Arbitration
If we and you do not agree whether coverage is provided under this policy for a claim or regulatory proceeding made against you or claim expenses, costs, or damages incurred by you, then either party may make a written demand for arbitration.


---


When this demand is made, each party will select an arbitrator. The two arbitrators will select a third. If they cannot agree within thirty (30) days, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. Each party will:

- Pay the expenses it incurs; and
- Bear the expenses of the third arbitrator equally.

SPECIMEN

Unless both parties agree otherwise, arbitration will take place in the county in which the address shown in the Declarations is located. Local rules of law as to procedure and evidence will apply. A decision agreed to by two of the arbitrators will be binding.

## P. Changes
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no provision of this policy may be amended, waived, or otherwise changed except by endorsement issued by us to form part of this policy.

## Q. Cancellation or Non-Renewal
1. This policy may be canceled by you by surrender thereof and selection of a future date to us at the address stated in the Declarations or by mailing to us written notice stating when thereafter such cancellation shall be effective. If this policy is canceled by you, we shall retain the customary short-rate portion of the premium.

2. The policy may be canceled by us by mailing you written notice stating when, not less than forty-five (45) days thereafter or ten (10) days in the case of cancellation for non-payment of premium or deductible, such cancellation shall become effective. If the policy is canceled by us, earned premium shall be computed pro-rata.

3. In the event we refuse to renew this policy, we shall mail to you, not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration of this policy, written notice of non-renewal. Such notice shall be inclusive on all of you.

4. The mailing of Notice of Cancellation or Non-Renewal aforementioned shall be sufficient notice of the intent to cancel or non-renewal. The effective date of cancellation or non-renewal specified in the notice shall terminate this policy period.

## R. Conformity to Statutes
Terms of this policy which are in conflict with the statutes of the state wherein this policy is issued are hereby amended to conform with such statutes.

## S. Compliance with Trade Sanctions

b. Made by or with the knowledge or consent of any knowledgeable
person
3. This policy is void with respect to any insured that knew of any material
misstatement, misrepresentation, or omission in the application or other

U.     Liability Coverage Disputed and Reservation of Rights
If a controversy or dispute arises with regard to whether coverage exists with respect to a
claim or regulatory proceeding submitted by you under the coverage sections of this
policy, we may elect to provide a defense under a Reservation of Rights whereby we
reserve our rights to deny and reject any claim or regulatory proceeding for damages
or claims expenses. In the event it is finally established by judgment or agreement that
we have no liability with respect to such a claim or regulatory proceeding, you shall
reimburse us upon demand all sums and monies paid by us to defend and/or settle such
claim or regulatory proceeding.

V.     False or Fraudulent Claims
If you shall commit fraud in presenting any claims, regulatory proceedings, costs, or
damages as regards amounts or otherwise, this insurance shall become void as to such
insured from the date such fraudulent claims, regulatory proceedings, costs, or
damages are presented.

W.     Entire Agreement
By accepting this policy, you agree that this policy contains all agreements between you
and us concerning this insurance. Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any
agent or by any other person shall not be considered a waiver or a change in any part of
this policy or stop us from asserting any right under the terms of this policy; nor shall the
terms of this policy be waived or changed, except by endorsement signed by us and
issued to become a part of this policy.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, WE HAVE CAUSED THIS POLICY TO BE SIGNED BY OUR PRESIDENT
AND SECRETARY. THIS POLICY SHALL NOT BE VALID UNLESS SIGNED ON THE
DECLARATIONS PAGE BY OUR DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE.
