## HOW MUCH WE WILL PAY
The maximum amount payable by us in respect of each Section and each Insuring Clause will not exceed the limit of liability.

Where any claim is covered under multiple Sections, each Section will cover its part of the claim to the extent of the available limit of liability. In the event any Section covering the claim is exhausted, no other Section of the Policy covering the claim will provide additional cover. Regardless of how many Sections cover any claim, only one overall limit of liability will be available and this will be the highest limit of liability of the Sections covering the claim. The limits of liability available, other than the highest limit of liability, under the Sections covering the claim will always be a part of and not in addition to the highest limit of liability. For the purposes of this paragraph, INSURING CLAUSES 7, 8 and 9 will each be considered a Section.


---


Where more than one claim under this Policy arises from the same original cause or single source or event, all of those claims will be deemed to be one claim and only one limit of liability will be payable.

We may at any time pay to you in connection with any claim the amount of the limit of liability (after deduction of any amounts already paid). Upon that payment being made we will relinquish the conduct and control of the claim and be under no further liability in connection with that claim except for the payment of costs and expenses incurred prior to the date of such payment (unless the limit of liability is stated to be inclusive of costs and expenses).

If costs and expenses are stated in the Declarations page to be in addition to the limit of liability, or if the operation of local laws require costs and expenses to be paid in addition to the limit of liability, and if a damages payment in excess of the limit of liability has to be made to dispose of any claim, our liability for costs and expenses will be in the same proportion as the limit of liability bears to the total amount of the damages payment.

YOUR DEDUCTIBLE

We will only be liable for that part of each and every claim which exceeds the amount of the deductible. If any expenditure is incurred by us which falls within the amount of the deductible, then you will reimburse that amount to us upon our request.

Where more than one claim under this Policy arises from the same original cause or single source or event all of those claims will be deemed to be one claim and only one deductible will apply.

In respect of INSURING CLAUSE 5 (SECTIONS B and D only), a single waiting period, deductible and indemnity period will apply to each claim. Where the same original cause or single source or event causes more than one period of computer systems downtime these will be considered one period of computer systems downtime whose total duration is equal to the cumulative duration of each individual period of computer systems downtime

Where cover is provided under multiple Sections or multiple Insuring Clauses only one deductible will apply to that claim and this will be the highest deductible of the Sections under which cover is provided.

## 1. What you must do in the event of a claim or cyber incident

If any senior executive officer becomes aware of any incident which may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim under this Policy you must:

* a. notify the claims managers as soon as is reasonably practicable (in respect of cyber incidents, a telephone call to our cyber incident response hotline will constitute notification).

In respect of INSURING CLAUSES 1 and 6 (SECTION G only), if you notify an incident that we agree is reasonably expected to give rise to a claim, we will accept any claim that arises out of the incident as being notified under this Policy.

We require you to provide full details of the incident, including but not limited to:

* Before we indemnify any additional insured they must:

* Where a third party is treated as an additional insured as a result of this Condition, any claim made by that third party against you will be treated by us as if they were a third party and not as an insured.

## 3. Agreement to pay claims (duty to defend)
* We have the right and duty to take control of and conduct in your name the investigation, settlement or defense of any claim. We will not have any duty to pay costs and expenses for any part of a claim that is not covered by this Policy.

If we cannot settle using these means, we will pay the amount which you are found liable to pay either in court or through arbitration proceedings, subject to the limit of liability.

* We will not settle any claim without your consent. If you refuse to provide your consent to a settlement recommended by us and elect to continue legal proceedings in connection with the claim, any further costs and expenses incurred will be paid by you and us on a proportional basis, with 50% payable by us and 50% payable by you. As a consequence of your refusal, our liability for the claim, excluding costs and expenses, will not be more than the amount for which the claim could have been settled.

The misrepresentation or non-disclosure of any matter by you or your agent will render this Policy null and void and relieve us from all liability under this Policy.

## 5. Calculation of business interruption losses
Following an interruption to your business activities covered under INSURING CLAUSE 5 (SECTIONS B, C or D only), you must provide us with your calculation of the loss including:

* a. how the loss has been calculated and what assumptions have been made; and
* b. supporting documents including account statements, sales projections and invoices.

## 6. Cancellation
This Policy may be canceled with 30 days written notice by either you or us.

If you give us notice of cancellation, the return premium will be in proportion to the number of days that the Policy is in effect. However, if you have made a claim under this Policy there will be no return premium.

If we give you notice of cancellation, the return premium will be in proportion to the number of days that the Policy is in effect.

We also reserve the right of cancellation in the event that any amount due to us by you remains unpaid more than 60 days beyond the inception date. If we exercise this right of cancellation it will take effect from 14 days after the date the written notice of cancellation is issued.

The Policy Administration Fee will be deemed fully earned upon inception of the Policy.

## 7. Continuous cover
In respect of INSURING CLAUSES 1 and 6 (SECTION G only), if during the period of a previous renewal of this Policy you neglected, through error or oversight only, to report to us an incident that might give rise to a claim, then provided you have maintained uninterrupted insurance of the same type with us since expiry of the previous renewal of this Policy, we will permit the incident to be reported to us under this Policy and we will indemnify you under this Policy in respect of any claim that arises out of the incident, provided:

* a. the indemnity will be subject to the applicable limit of liability of the previous renewal of this Policy under which the incident should have been reported to us or the applicable limit of liability, whichever is the lower;



---


## 7. Indemnity and notification

- b. we may reduce the indemnity entitlement by the monetary equivalent of any prejudice which has been suffered as a result of the delayed notification; and
- c. the indemnity will be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Policy.

We require you to provide full details of the incident, including but not limited to:
- a. the time, place and nature of the incident;
- b. the manner in which you first became aware of this incident;
- c. reasons why you believe that this incident could give rise to a claim;
- d. the identity of the potential claimant; and
- e. an indication as to the size of the claim that could result from this incident.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Condition only applies to incidents that might give rise to a claim.

## 8. Cross liability and severability

In respect of INSURING CLAUSE 6 only, where there is more than one entity insured under this Policy, and subject to the limit of liability, any claim made by one insured entity against another insured entity will be treated as if they are a third party and knowledge possessed by one insured entity will not be imputed to any other insured entity.

## 9. Dispute resolution

All disputes or differences between you and us will be referred to mediation or arbitration and will take place in the country of registration of the company named as the insured in the Declarations page.

In respect of any arbitration proceeding we will follow the applicable rules of the arbitration association in the country where the company stated as the insured in the Declarations page is registered, the rules of which are deemed incorporated into this Policy by reference to this Condition. Unless the applicable arbitration association rules state otherwise, a single arbitrator will be appointed who will be mutually agreed between you and us. If you and we cannot agree on a suitable appointment then we will refer the appointment to the applicable arbitration association.

Each party will bear its own fees and costs in connection with any mediation or arbitration proceeding but the fees and expenses of the arbitrator will be shared equally between you and us unless the arbitration award provides otherwise.

Nothing in this Condition is intended to remove your rights under CONDITION 21. However, if a determination is made in any mediation or arbitration proceeding, CONDITION 21 is intended only as an aid to enforce this determination.

## 10. Fraudulent claims
If it is determined by final adjudication, arbitral tribunal or written admission by you, that you notified us of any claim knowing it to be false or fraudulent in any way, we will have no responsibility to pay that claim, we may recover from you any sums paid in respect of that claim and we reserve the right to terminate this Policy from the date of the fraudulent act. If we exercise this right, we will not be liable to return any premium to you. However, this will not affect any non-fraudulent claim under this Policy which has been previously notified to us.

## 11. Extended reporting period
An extended reporting period of 60 days following the expiry date will be automatically granted at no additional premium. This extended reporting period will cover, subject to all other terms, conditions and exclusions of this Policy:

- b. in respect of INSURING CLAUSES 2, 3, 4 and 5, any cyber event, system failure or loss first discovered by you during this optional extended reporting period, provided that the cyber event, system failure or loss first occurred during the period of the policy.

# 12. Optional extended reporting period
If you would like to purchase the optional extended reporting period you must notify us and pay us the optional extended reporting period premium stated in the Declarations page within 30 days of cancellation or non-renewal.

The right to the optional extended reporting period will not be available to you where cancellation or non-renewal by us is due to non-payment of the premium or your failure to pay any amounts in excess of the applicable limit of liability or within the amount of the applicable deductible as is required by this Policy in the payment of claims.

At the renewal of this Policy, our quotation of different premium, deductible, limits of liability or changes in policy language will not constitute non-renewal by us.

# 13. Maintenance of employee automobile liability insurance
It is a condition precedent to indemnity under INSURING CLAUSE 6 (SECTIONS H and I only) that all employees who operate an automobile in the course of your business activities will maintain in full force and effect for the period of the policy primary automobile liability insurance in an amount equal to, or greater than, the minimum primary automobile liability limits required in the state of registration of the automobile. If you make a claim under INSURING CLAUSE 6 (SECTIONS H and I only) and the employee has failed to meet these requirements then this Policy will only respond to provide excess coverage as though the requirements had been met, whereby you agree to pay all sums within and up to the required minimum limit.

# 14. Mergers and acquisitions
If you acquire an entity during the period of the policy whose annual revenue does not exceed 20% of the company's annual revenue, as stated in its most recent annual financial statements, cover is automatically extended under this Policy to include the entity as a subsidiary.

If you acquire an entity during the period of the policy whose annual revenue exceeds 20% of the company's annual revenue, as stated in its most recent annual financial statements, cover is automatically extended under this Policy to include the entity as a subsidiary for 45 days.

We will consider providing cover for the acquired entity after the period of 45 days if:
- a. you give us full details of the entity within 45 days of its acquisition; and
- b. you accept any amendment to the terms and conditions of this Policy and agree to pay any additional premium required by us.

In the event you do not comply with a. and b. above, cover will automatically terminate for the entity 45 days after the date of its acquisition.

Cover for any acquired entity is only provided under this Policy for any act, error or omission committed or alleged to have been committed on or after the date of its acquisition.

## 15. New subsidiaries

If you create an entity during the period of the policy cover is automatically extended under this Policy to include the entity as a subsidiary for 45 days.

We will consider providing cover for the created entity after the period of 45 days if:

- a. you give us full details of the entity within 45 days of its creation; and
- b. you accept any amendment to the terms and conditions of this Policy and agree to pay any additional premium required by us.

In the event you do not comply with a. and b. above, cover will automatically terminate for the entity 45 days after the date of its creation.

No cover will be automatically provided under this Policy for any created entity whose business activities are materially different from your business activities.

## 16. Our rights of recovery

If we make any payment under this Policy and you have any right of recovery against a third party in respect of this payment, then we will maintain this right of recovery. You will do whatever is reasonably necessary to secure this right and will not do anything after the event which gave rise to the claim to prejudice this right.

We will not exercise any rights of recovery against any employee, unless this is in respect of any fraudulent or dishonest acts or omissions as proven by final adjudication, arbitral tribunal or written admission by the employee.

Any recoveries will be applied as follows:



---


## 17. Prior subsidiaries
Should an entity cease to be a subsidiary after the inception date, cover in respect of the entity will continue as if it was still a subsidiary during the period of the policy, but only in respect of an act, error, omission or event occurring prior to the date that it ceased to be a subsidiary.

## 18. Process for paying privacy breach notification costs
Any privacy breach notification transmitted by you or on your behalf must be done with our prior written consent. We will ensure          that notification is                   compliant with any legal or regulatory requirements and contractual obligations. No offer must be made for financial incentives, gifts, coupons, credits or services unless with our prior written consent which will only be provided if the offer is commensurate with the risk of harm.

     We will not be liable for any portion of the costs you incur under                    INSURING CLAUSE 3
     (SECTION E only) that exceed the costs that you would have incurred had you gained our prior written consent. In the absence of our prior written consent we will only be liable to pay you   the equivalent cost of a notification    made using        the                  most cost effective means permissible under the governing law.

## 19. Waiver of subrogation
Notwithstanding CONDITION 16, we agree to waive our rights of recovery against any third party if, prior to the claim or incident which you reasonably expected to give rise to a claim, you entered into a contract that contains a provision requiring you to do this.

## 20. Sanctions suspension
It is a condition under this Policy that the provision of cover, the payment of any claim and the provision of any benefit will be suspended, to the extent that the provision of the cover, payment of the claim or provision of the benefit would expose us to any sanction, prohibition or restriction under the United Nations resolutions or the trade or economic sanctions, laws or regulations of Australia, Canada, the European Union, United Kingdom or United States of America. The suspension will continue until such time we would no longer be exposed to the sanction, prohibition or restriction.

## 21. Choice of law, jurisdiction and service of suit
In the event of a dispute between you                         and us regarding this Policy, the dispute will be governed by the laws of the State of the United States of America shown as the choice of law
