### Customized Property Coverage with CNA ParamountSM

Designed specifically for your mid to large-sized customers, CNA ParamountSM provides a range of essential coverages, plus industry-leading risk control programs and support. Coverages include:

* Electronic vandalism — This provides coverage for the costs to replace or restore direct physical loss or damage to electronic data as a result of denial-of-service attacks, electronic infections or network impairment caused by vandals anywhere in the world
* Electronic data processing (EDP) — Computers, servers and other EDP equipment are included as part of CNA Paramount’sSM Personal Property limit. This equipment is sometimes handled by other carriers as part of a “basket” of additional coverages that can potentially limit recovery to this “basket” limit
* Technology service provider coverage — If service is interrupted because an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or server farm goes offline due to loss or damage to its property, if time element coverage applies, CNA ParamountSM provides coverage for business income lost due to delay of operations as a result of the outage
* Supply chain disruption — We understand you may rely on hardware or components from a number of vendors and suppliers. If one of those vendors suffers a loss that prevents it from providing parts to one of your direct suppliers, and you lose business income as a result of the delay, that income would be reimbursed, as would any expedited shipping costs paid for the parts
* International mobile computing device coverage — Provides coverage on smart phones, tablets and other mobile devices used internationally
