# Technology Professional Liability
## Claim Examples

* Website Designer: The insured is a website designer who also provides help with online marketing strategies for clients. One client is a children's video production company who wants a website that will provide online access to snippets of their new children's video series. The insured creates a website with three uniquely attired cartoon animals who prompt children through the website. Unbeknownst to the insured, these three animals bear an uncanny resemblance to characters in a recently published children's book. The publisher sues the television production company for copyright infringement, who in turn sue the insured.

* Computer Consultant: The insured specializes in consulting for growth oriented companies, primarily making recommendations for information management strategies. One of their customers is an insurance company which has just gone public. Half of the $25,000,000 in proceeds from the offering paid for a brand new processing system recommended by the insured, which promises to enable the company to cut down on labor costs and be virtually paperless within two years of implementation. Also, the insurance company sold itself to Wall Street as being at the vanguard of technologically advanced and cost efficient insurance companies. The Insured oversees the project from beginning to end. At the end of two years, the company has had to make up for the system’s many shortfalls by hiring additional consultants and programmers which has increased labor costs. In addition, paper usage has not been significantly reduced. Also, Wall Street has noticed the insurance company’s increasing expense ratio, decreasing the value of the stock. In addition to suing the firm which developed the processing system, the insurance company sues the consultant for not performing due diligence in examining the suitability of the processing system in seeking damages totaling $12,500,000.

* Software Developer: The insured develops custom software according to the needs of clients. One project involves writing an inventory tracking system for a national wholesale furniture distributor. The distributor depends on this software to determine how many reclining chairs to order from furniture makers. A purchasing agent for the distributor notices that, according to the inventory tracking system, 1000 green Armchair Quarterback brand recliners are needed to keep up with the nations wide demand, and he orders them at $500 each. After half of these have been produced, the purchasing agent realizes that only 10 of these recliners have been sold in the past year. Further investigation reveals an error in the programming of the tracking system. Also, the furniture maker insists on payment for the armchairs already produced. The distributor sues the insured for the unrecoverable costs of $250,000.

* Data Processing Firm: A pension plan administrator contracts with the insured to perform claim payment and check processing. Over the course of six months, the insured erroneously makes improper payment totaling $150,000, leaving the plan underfunded. The pension plan administrator sues to recover the lost funds.

* Computer System Designer: The insured specializes in systems design for schools, including hardware assembly. Their work usually takes place after school hours, but the lateness of a project to equip a science laboratory with twenty PCs forces them to perform the project during school hours. The insured is finishing just as the seventh-grade students enter the classroom. Some wires are still exposed, and one student suffers a fall which causes them to hospitalized. The parents sue the school for the cost of the hospital bills and the school in turn sues the system designer.

# Technology Professional Package

Errors and Omissions, General Liability and Property Coverage for Technology Firms

## Why Do you need Errors and Omissions Coverage?

- Your clients can sue you for negligence in providing professional services, regardless of fault; Even frivolous lawsuits can incur significant defense costs
- General liability policies exclude professional services; errors and omissions insurance is the only way to protect your company
- Many professionals purchase professional liability coverage simply to fulfill a contract requirement, but real world risks can threaten the very existence of a business
- Programming errors, improper system installation/integration, and hardware maintenance are important areas of exposure for technology service providers
- Allegations of copyright infringement, transmission of a virus or unauthorized access to a client’s system due to your error can result in losses in excess of $100,000. Can you afford to pay for your clients’ economic losses that result?

## Florida and Illinois Punitive Damage Notice
I understand that there is no coverage for punitive damages assessed directly against an insured under Florida and Illinois law. However, I also understand that punitive damages that are not assessed directly against an insured, also known as “vicariously assessed punitive damages”, are insurable under Florida and Illinois law. Therefore, if any Policy is issued to the Applicant as a result of this Application and such Policy provides coverage for punitive damages, I understand and acknowledge that the coverage for Claims brought in the State of Florida and Illinois is limited to “vicariously assessed punitive damages” and that there is no coverage for directly assessed punitive damages.

## Maine Notice
The insurer is not permitted to withdraw any binder once issued, but a prospective notice of cancellation may be sent and coverage denied for fraud or material misrepresentation in obtaining coverage. A policy may not be unilaterally rescinded or voided.

## New York Disclosure Notice
This policy is written on a claims made basis and shall provide no coverage for claims arising out of incidents, occurrences or alleged Wrongful Acts or Wrongful Employment Acts that took place prior to retroactive date, if any, stated on the declarations.

The policy includes an automatic 60 day extended claims reporting period following the termination of this policy. The Insured may purchase for an additional premium an additional extended reporting period of 12 months, 24 months or 36 months following the termination of this policy.

I understand and acknowledge that if a $100,000 or $250,000 Limit of Liability is chosen or if the Insured Organization has more than 200 employees, that Defense Costs are a part of the Limit of Liability. This means that Defense Costs will reduce my limits of insurance and may exhaust them completely and should that occur, I shall be liable for any further legal Defense Costs and Damages.
